    <p>
        This game literally has the same plot as the movie "The Departed". Which is to say the plot is really
        nothing new and sometimes can feel rushed. <br> But the combat has an amazing flow with environmental 
        takedowns that are super fun to pull of, and the setting is also very refreshing. Set in contemporary
        Hong Kong, <br> it definitely isn't the largest urban game world, but it is a city with countless 
        distractions. Most importanly the city feels alive. Also there are slow motion car chases. <br> 
        I rest my case.
