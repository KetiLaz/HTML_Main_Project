        This really is a serious mafia drama until the game makes to take a break and sing karaoke that 
        halfway turns into an extravagant music video. At that moment I realised <br> that this game would be 
        stupid fun. I was not wrong. Fish giant white sharks from a river? Check. Have a disco dance-off? 
        Check. Get a chicken named Nugget to be your manager? <br> Sure. This game does not take itself 
        seriously in the best possible way and I love it for it.
