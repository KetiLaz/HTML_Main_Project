        Originally a PS2 game, I only had the chance to play it when it came to PS4. Although sometimes its 
        PS2 roots are evident it is such a unique game that you won't care. <br> The style of the game is 
        inspired by traditional Japanese watercolour art and the world itself is a canvas, manipulated through 
        the player's most valuable tool: <br> the Celestial Brush. For example using the Celestial Brush
        you can draw a circle in the sky and turn night into day. Did I mention that you play as a the wolf
        sun goddess? <br> Okami is unlike any game I've had played before or have played since.
