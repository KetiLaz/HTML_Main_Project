        In terms of difficult, yes, you can say that this is a soulslike platformer. After all, I've rage 
        quit this game two times. But I always return to this game <br> because of its beautiful style and
        atmosphere, the sombre soundtrack and the solid gaming mechanics. It baffles me how a team of just
        four people <br> made such a deeply beautiful game.
