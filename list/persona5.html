    <p>
        I've never cared for turn-based combat games. I've never got it and for that I lost on some very
        good video games.  But this game is so brilliant, <br> that it made me sit throught 100 hours of 
        turn-based combat and I loved it. This game just has amazing style, an incredible soundtrack,
        an intriguing story, <br> intence combat and it's just so much fun. So after 100 hours of gameplay, my
        first instict was to hit New Game+ and enjoy it all over again.
