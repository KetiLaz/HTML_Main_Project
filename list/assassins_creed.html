        I played this game when I was 13-14 years old and although I grew up  playing video games, this was
        the one that solidified to me that I would be a gamer my whole life. <br> I finished Assassin's Creed II
        too many times. I loved the premise, the story but most of all I loved the setting: the height of the
        Rennaissance in Italy. <br> Just walking around in Florence and Venice in this game was fun.
