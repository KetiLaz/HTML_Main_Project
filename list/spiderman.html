        Spider-Man is a game that I've platinumed. And getting platinum trophies is not something that I do 
        often (I only have three of them, including the Spider-Man one). <br> Even finding the collectibles is fun 
        in this game, something that usually is very tidious in other video games. I would play this game just to swing around New York City.
