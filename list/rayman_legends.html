    <p>
        Rayman Legends is one of my comfort games. It is a simple platformer with just three basic mechanics:
        run, jump, hit. <br> The excellent level design thought turns the game into a wonderful and fun game. 
        The goal of the game is simple: <br> save all 700 teensies throught the levels. Of course I spend too
        many hours finding all 700 of them. Oh, there are also music levels. <br> Platforming in sync with 
        the music is so satisfying.
