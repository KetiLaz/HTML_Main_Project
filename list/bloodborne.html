    <p> This game was the first Soulsborne game that I ever played and it will always have a special place 
        in my heart. Like all Soulsborne games it is hard as nails <br> and I almost quit after I died over
        and over and over again to the first boss. But after I finally beat him something clicked in me 
        and that was it. I absolutely adore this game <br> and since I first finished it, 
        I did it all over again and now I'm making a friend of mine play it with me. Again.
