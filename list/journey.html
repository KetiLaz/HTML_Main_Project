        You will only need about three hours to complete this game. This is the game I refer to when I say 
        that video games can be art. It is an absolutely stunning game <br> with a story open to interpretation.
        There are no rules or instructions or even real objectives in this game. You are free to explore the 
        beautiful world on your own pace. <br> Journey transcends conventional gaming and becomes more of an 
        interactive experience designed to evoke feelings, thus making it a great gateway fron non players <br>
        to get into video games.
